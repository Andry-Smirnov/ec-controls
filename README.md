Components below are listed in order of their appearance on the component palette. All screenshots are taken from KDE4 or Plasma5 (Lazarus+Qt).

### Visual

#### `TECBevel`

An alternative to [TBevel](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TBevel "TBevel").

[![tecbevel.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/d/d5/tecbevel.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecbevel.png)

[`TECBevel`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECBevel&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECBevel (page does not exist)") can draw non-rectangular shapes or non-straight lines.

#### `TECLink`

[`TECLink`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECLink&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECLink (page does not exist)") provides a weblink. The same links are well known from web-browsers.

[![teclink.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/2/2d/teclink.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:teclink.png)

A label which changes its look when hovered by mouse (by default becomes underlined and blue).

It can open URL in default browser, default mail client, file in associated application or just trigger `OnClick` event.

#### `TECImageMenu`

A vertical menu with images. Similar component is frequently used in KDE4 applications and Outlook97

[![tecimagemenu.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/8/81/tecimagemenu.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecimagemenu.png)

[`TECImageMenu`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECImageMenu&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECImageMenu (page does not exist)") can have focus and can be reached by Tab key (when `TabStop = True`, which is default). Can be controlled by mouse, by keyboard or by code.

##### Mouse

- Simply left-click on menu item.
- Middle-click or right-click selects an item but does not click.
- Mouse wheel moves the selection and does not click.

##### Keyboard

- `Space` and `Enter`: click on the selected item.
- `Arrow Up`, `Arrow Down`, `Page Up`, `Page Down`, `Home` and `End`: moves the selection but does not click.
- Acceleration key (`Alt` + Key) selects and clicks the relevant item (menu doesn't need to be focused)..

#### `TECSpinBtns`

An advanced alternative to [`TUpDown`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TUpDown "TUpDown").

[![tecspinbtns.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/3/34/tecspinbtns.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecspinbtns.png)

[`TECSpinBtns`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpinBtns&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpinBtns (page does not exist)") is based on double precision variables.

`TECSpinBtns` cannot have focus. Can be controlled by mouse or by code.

##### Mouse

`TECSpinBtns` consists from 9 small buttons.

- Left-click on `BtnMin`, `BtnBigDec`, `BtnDec`, `BtnMiddle`, `BtnMenu`, `BtnInc`, `BtnBigInc` and `BtnMax` sets the `Value` to `Min`, decreases Value by PageSize, decreases Value by Increment, sets `Value` to `Middle`, triggers `OnMenuClick` event, increases `Value` by `Increment`, increases `Value` by `PageSize` and sets `Value` to `Max` respectively.
- Middle-click sets `Value` to `Middle` or triggers `OnMenuClick` - depends on `MenuControl` property. Other mouse buttons can be used for dragging too, depends on `DragControl` property. Dragging mainly depends on properties: `DragOrientation`, `MouseIncrementX`, `MouseIncrementY`, `MouseStepPixelsX`, `MouseStepPixelsY` and `Reversed`.

##### Code

Simply by assigning any floating-point value to property `Value`:

```pascal
Value := 10.5;
```

If the value is out of range (lesser than `Min` or greater than `Max`) then Value will be `Min` or `Max`.

##### Precendence of drawing:

1. The highest precedence has the `OnDrawGlyph` event.
2. The second is `Caption`. It should be short (one or two characters).
3. The third is image from Images. Images must be assigned and ImageIndex must be greater or equal to zero and lesser than `Images.Count`
4. When the `OnDrawGlyph` is not assigned, `Caption` is empty string and `ImageIndex` is `-1` then built-in glyph is used. There is five sets of styles, they can be selected with `GlyphStyle` property.

#### `TECSpinEdit`

An advanced alternative to `TSpinEdit` and `TFloatSpinEdit`. It is [`TEdit`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TEdit "TEdit") joined together with `TECSpinBtns`.

[![tecspinedit.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/4/40/tecspinedit.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecspinedit.png)

[`TECSpinEdit`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpinEdit&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpinEdit (page does not exist)") can have focus and can be reached by Tab key (when `TabStop = True`, which is default). Can be controlled by mouse, by keyboard or by code.

##### Mouse

See [`TECSpinBtns`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpinBtns&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpinBtns (page does not exist)").

##### Keyboard

(line-edit must be focused)

`Text` value can typed in to the line-edit directly. If entered value is lesser than `TECSpinBtnsPlus.MinInEdit` or greater than `TECSpinBtnsPlus.MaxInEdit` then the value will be changed to fit these bounds. Change of `Value` is done in `OnEditingDone` event.

- Arrow Up/Down do click on `BtnInc`/`BtnDec`.
- `PgUp`/`PgDn` do click on `BtnBigInc`/`BtnBigDec`.
- `Ctrl` + Home/End do click on `BtnMax`/`BtnMin`.
- `Ctrl` + Space do click `BtnMiddle`.
- `Ctrl` + Enter do click on `BtnMenu`.

> valid for `Reversed = False`. For `Reversed = True` works oppositely.

##### Code

Simply by assigning any floating-point value to property `Value`:

```pascal
Value := 10.5;
```

If the value is out of range (lesser than Min or greater than Max) then Value will be Min or Max.

#### `TECSwitch`

An alternative to `TCheckBox`. Similar component exists in GTk3.

[![tecswitch.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/1/19/tecswitch.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecswitch.png)

[`TECSwitch`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSwitch&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSwitch (page does not exist)") can have focus and can be reached by Tab key (when `TabStop = True`, which is default). Can be controlled by mouse, by keyboard or by code.

##### Mouse

- Left-click on switch area (out of knob) will change the `State`.
- Left-click on the knob and holding the left-mouse button down will capture mouse and knob can be moved even if the mouse-cursor leaves the area of the switch.

##### Keyboard

- `Space` or `Enter` changes the `State` (only when focused).
- Acceleration key (`Alt` + Key) changes the `State` (doesn't need to be focused).

##### Code

Simply by assigning any -`State`_ or `Checked` property:

```pascal
Checked := True; //False
State := cbChecked; //cbGrayed, cbUnchecked
```

> Property State is always changed from checked to unchecked, from grayed to unchecked or from unchecked to checked.

#### `TECSpeedBtn`

A button with some advanced features and built-in glyphs. An alternative to `TSpeedButton` and TToggleBox.

[![tecspeedbtn.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/c/c3/tecspeedbtn.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tecspeedbtn.png)

[`TECSpeedBtn`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpeedBtn&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpeedBtn (page does not exist)") cannot have focus.

Features and differences from [`TSpeedButton`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TSpeedButton "TSpeedButton"):

- `TSpeedButton` has property `Glyph: TBitmap`. `TECSpeedBtn` has properties `ImageIndex: Integer` and `Images: `[`TImageList`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TImageList "TImageList") instead.
- `TECSpeedBtn` has property `Delay` and built-in timer. Therefore it can work as a delay-button (`Delay > 0`) or toggle-box (`Delay < 0`).
- `TECSpeedBtn` has more than 80 built-in glyph (painted via [`TCanvas`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TCanvas "TCanvas") helper). `Glyphs` can be various for checked and unchecked state.
- Similarly to `TSpeedButton`, `TECSpeedBtn` has properties `GroupIndex`, Checked and `AllowAllUp` so buttons can be grouped to radio-group.
- `TECSpeedBtn` cannot obtain focus but can be pressed by acceleration key (`Alt`+ [underlined key]).
- `TECSpeedBtn` can be linked with [`TAction`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TAction "TAction") too.

##### Precendence of drawing:

1. The highest precedence has the `OnDrawGlyph` event.
2. The second is `Caption` and image from `Images`. `Images` must be assigned and at least on of `ImageIndex` and `ImageIndexChecked` must be greater or equal to zero and lesser than Images.Count.
3. When the `OnDrawGlyph` is not assigned and both `ImageIndex` and `ImageIndexChecked` are `-1` then built-in glyph is used (properties `GlyphDesign` and `GlyphDesignChecked`). When `ImageIndex` is valid Image and `ImageIndexChecked` is `-1` or only GlyphDesign is some glyph and `GlyphDesignChecked` is egdNone then `ImageIndex` or `GlyphDesign` is used for checked state too (and vice versa).

#### `TECBitBtn`

The same as `TECSpeedBtn` but derived from `TCustomControl`, therefore it can have focus. An alternative to `TBitBtn` and `TToggleBox`.

[`TECSpinBtns`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpinBtns&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpinBtns (page does not exist)") and [`TECSpinEdit`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECSpinEdit&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECSpinEdit (page does not exist)") have properties `Controller`. When some `SpinController` is assigned to this property then this `Controller` can change selected properties of all assigned `TECSpinEdits` and `TECSpinBtns` at a time. Adjustable properties are - for example - `TimerDelay`, `TimerRepeat`, widths of individual buttons, `GlyphsStyle` and others.

Project can have multiple `SpinControllers`.

#### `TECTimer`

An advanced timer.

[![tectimericon.png](https://wiki.freepascal.org/images/d/d8/tectimericon.png)](https://wiki.freepascal.org/File:tectimericon.png)

Main feature is that the first interval (property `Delay`) can differ from all following intervals (property `Repeat`).

### Other parts of EC-Controls

#### Class `TECScale`

A scale. It is not a component but can draw itself to any canvas.

This class is used in `TECRuler`, `TECSlider`, `TECProgressBar`, `TECPositionBar` and `TECSpinPosition`.

See demo `ECScale-Demo`.

#### Unit `ECTypes`

Base types and classes for Eye Candy Controls (EC-C).

If you use EC-Controls in your project you may need to add this unit to your **uses** section.

This unit contains many declarations, color-conversion routines and base classes, for example `TBaseScrollControl`.

#### `TBaseScrollControl`

is base class for scrolling components (TECScheme is its descendant).

You can derive your own scrolling component from `TBaseScrollControl`. [`TECScheme`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECScheme&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECScheme (page does not exist)") and [`TECGrid`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/TECGrid "TECGrid") are based on this class.

## Demos

EC-Controls come with several demos. If some of following demos is missing in archive, it may mean that there were no changes and the demo was not included. In that case use the demo from previous release.

### `ECC-Demo`

This demo shows all EC-Controls in various configurations.

### `ECScale-Demo`

This demo shows how you can use [`TECScale`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECScale&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECScale (page does not exist)") in our own visual component.

### `ECConfCurve-Demo`

This demo shows capabilities of [`TECConfCurve`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TECConfCurve&action=edit&redlink=1 "TECConfCurve (page does not exist)").

### `ECSchemeDesc`

This demo shows how you can create descendant component from [`TCustomECScheme`](https://wiki.freepascal.org/index.php?title=TCustomECScheme&action=edit&redlink=1 "TCustomECScheme (page does not exist)").

### `SchemeDesigner`

`SchemeDesigner` is more than a demo. It shows you how you can create `TECScheme` configurator in your own application but it can be also used to create your own configurations and store them in xml format.
